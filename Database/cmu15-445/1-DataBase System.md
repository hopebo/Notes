## 2 Relational Model

A **relation** is a unordered set that contain the relationship of attributes that represent entities.

A **tuple** is a set of attribute values (also known as its domain) in the relation.

-   The special value NULL is a member of each domain.

A relation's **primary key** uniquely identifies a single tuple.

A **foreign key** specifies that an attribute from one relation has to map to a tuple in another relation.
